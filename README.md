# degradation_rate

We present the functions and workflow to calculate protein degradation rate from quantitative Western data using an exponential one phase model.

Data is publushed in *ARF-AID: A rapidly inducible protein degron system that preserves endogenous protein levels*

Input data to the function is a tab-delimitted text fiel with the headers "frac" (fraction of protein) and "time".
